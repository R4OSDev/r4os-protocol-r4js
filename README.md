# R4JS.R4P

`R4JS.R4P` is an independent R4OS protocol module implemented in Zig.

## Package

- Version: `0.54.15`
- Image target: `/R4OS/PROTOCOLS/R4JS.R4P`
- Image scope: `full`
- Canonical project manifest: `module.R4MF`

The manifest is the single source of truth for the artifact, imports, image
target, and package metadata.

## Build

On Windows:

    Build.bat

On Linux:

    ./Build.sh

`Settings.R4S` selects the SDK tool owner. Its profiles define the verified
SDK, Contract and system library sources. `build.zig.zon` records the exact
standalone archive identities. The shared PowerShell build path binds the
actual selected sources and records its normal or explicit development mode.
